 I built a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to easily access accurate and up-to-date weather information. Through the power of these web technologies, I was able to create a user-friendly interface that displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

With HTML, I structured the app's layout, creating sections for the various weather details and incorporating responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing on different devices. CSS came in handy for styling, allowing me to customize the app's appearance, including fonts, colors, backgrounds, and iconography, to create an appealing and intuitive user interface.
JavaScript played a crucial role in fetching weather data from a reliable API, enabling real-time updates.This allowed users to instantly see the weather for their desired location without refreshing the page.

Additionally, I implemented interactive features using JavaScript, such as search functionality, where users can input a location and receive weather data specific to that area.
Overall, through the combined efforts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully developed a weather app that provides users with an enjoyable and informative experience, delivering accurate weather data in a visually pleasing manner.
